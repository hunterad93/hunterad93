# About Me üåü

## üìà Data Engineer & Analyst

Hello there! I'm a Data Scientist deeply passionate about leveraging data for environmental and business impact. Based in the picturesque landscapes of Missoula, Montana, my journey intertwines a love for nature with a knack for numbers.


### üîç Carbitrage
- **Role**: Data Engineer
- **Repository**: carbitrage
- **Key Contributions**: Developed a web scraping pipeline that improved on past project iterations, ultimately leading to a fully automated pipeline that scrapes all used car listings in the US each day which has run with minimal maintenance scraping over 1 million listings in the last 6 months. Created a NLP technique for listings that could not be cleaned easily with regex, via using fuzzy matching algorithims and OpenAI API calls. Deployed a cloud function to generate linear models predicting expected prices for used car listings, to highlight vehicles priced under market expectations, viewable in this [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/15724f59-7692-4920-95ac-a2c8f76029eb/page/jUEsD)
- **Skills**: ETL, Google Cloud Platform, Data Pipeline Design, SQL, Python

### üî• Advancing Wildfire Boundary Detection with Firenet
- **Role**: Data Engineer
- **Repository**: firenet
- **Key Contributions**: Spearheaded the operationalization of Firenet, an innovative neural network model that integrates geostationary and low Earth orbit satellite data to enhance wildfire detection and monitoring. Refactored a researcher's codebase for cloud deployment and orchestrated a series of cloud functions to make disparate satellite imagery sources interoperable in a maintainable pipeline. The pipeline outputs can be viewed on the projects website, where more information about the project can be found [firenet homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/firenet-/home).
- **Skills**: Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Satellite Imagery Analysis, PyTorch, Data Engineering, Google Cloud Platform.

### üå± Working with Renewably
- **Role**: Data Analyst
- **Repository**: grizemissions
- **Key Contributions**: Completed an emissions inventory for the University of Montana in collaboration with administrators and the Renewably team which made the [news](http://montana.com/news/local/um-emissions-highest-since-2011-after-new-data-added-to-inventory). Innovated NLP techniques to draw insights from thousands of transaction descriptions made in natural language, identifying which departments in the University were the drivers of air travel emissions, findings that were used to influence sustainability initiatives. An analysis of a commuter survey uncovered previously unrecognized commuting patterns, which led to the development of a plan to disincentivize parking permits in favor of pay-per-use parking to reduce car commuting.
- **Skills**: ETL, Data Entry, Statistics, Problem Solving.

### üçΩÔ∏è Consulting for Burke Hospitality LLC
- **Role**: Data Engineer
- **Achievements**: Developed an ETL pipeline that retrieved and aggregated data from a transaction processing API into a data warehouse. Deployed a model training process that retrained a time series sales forecasting model on the most recent 100,000 orders. Deployed a dashboard displaying forecasted sales by item each day, leading to a 30% reduction in chicken and ribs waste.
- **Skills**: Data Modeling, Analytical Skills, Data Science, Data Warehousing, JSON, Python.

- ### üåê Freelancing with Earth Analytics
- **Role**: Data Engineer
- **Contributions**: Used Google Earth Engine for environmental data analysis, developing predictive random forest models which had a 10% improvement in precision compared to past models. Generated predictive maps with a pipeline that downloaded cloud free composites of raster data from Google Earth Engine, transformed these into numpy arrays for inference with sci-kit learn, and piped predictions back into a coordinate reference system. These maps are being used to direct future field teams.
- **Skills**: ETL, Statistics, Problem Solving, Databases, Google Earth Engine, Scikit-Learn.

üîó Let's connect and collaborate on projects that make a difference! Feel free to reach out if you're interested in data-driven solutions or innovative business analytics.
