# About Me 🌟

## 📈 Data Scientist & Analyst

Hello there! I'm a Data Scientist deeply passionate about leveraging data for environmental and business impact. Based in the picturesque landscapes of Missoula, Montana, my journey intertwines a love for nature with a knack for numbers.

### 🔥 Advancing Wildfire Boundary Detection with Firenet
- **Project**: Firenet Wildfire Prediction Model
- **Role**: Data Scientist
- **Key Contributions**: Spearheaded the operationalization of Firenet, an innovative neural network model that integrates geostationary and low Earth orbit satellite data to enhance wildfire detection and monitoring. Refactored a researcher's codebase for cloud deployment and orchestrated a series of cloud functions to make disparate satellite imagery sources interoperable in a maintainable pipeline. The pipeline outputs can be viewed on the projects website, where more information about the project can be found [firenet homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/firenet-/home).
- **Skills**: Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Satellite Imagery Analysis, PyTorch, Data Engineering, DevOps.


### 🌱 Working with Renewably
- **Role**: Climate Data Intern
- **Key Contributions**: Developed a scalable and intuitive greenhouse gas emissions dashboard. Completed an emissions inventory for the University of Montana in collaboration with administrators and the Renewably team which made the [news](http://montana.com/news/local/um-emissions-highest-since-2011-after-new-data-added-to-inventory). I innovated NLP techniques to draw insights from transaction descriptions made in natural language, identifying which departments in the University were the drivers of air travel emissions, findings that were used to influence sustainability initiatives. An analysis of a commuter survey uncovered previously unrecognized commuting patterns, which led to the development of a plan to disincentivize parking permits in favor of pay-per-use parking to reduce car commuting.
- **Skills**: ETL, Data Entry, Statistics, Problem Solving.

### 🔍 Researching at University of Montana
- **Role**: Research Assistant
- **Projects**: Developed a web scraping pipeline that improved on past project iterations, ultimately leading to a fully automated pipeline that scrapes all used car listings in the US each day. Further developed a NLP technique for listings that could not be cleaned easily with regex, via using fuzzy matching algorithims and OpenAI API calls.
- **Skills**: ETL, Statistics, Problem Solving, Data Modeling, Selenium, LLM ops.

### 🌐 Freelancing with Earth Analytics
- **Role**: Data Scientist
- **Contributions**: Used Google Earth Engine for environmental data analysis, developing predictive random forest models which had a 10% improvement in precision compared to past models. Generated predictive maps with a pipeline that downloaded cloud free composites of raster data from Google Earth Engine, transformed these into numpy arrays for inference with sci-kit learn, and piped predictions back into a coordinate reference system. These maps will be used to direct future field teams.
- **Skills**: ETL, Statistics, Problem Solving, Databases, Google Earth Engine, Scikit-Learn.

### 🍽️ Consulting for Burke Hospitality LLC
- **Role**: Data Scientist
- **Achievements**: Created a machine learning model pipeline that reduced waste of chicken and ribs by around 30%. This was accomplished by downloading nested JSON transactional data from a OLTP API, unnesting and aggregating key menu items per day, and training an ARIMA time series model to generate predictions from the past week of sales.
- **Skills**: Data Modeling, Analytical Skills, Data Science, Data Warehousing, JSON, Python.
